### What I learned

I learned that using containers and positioning was the best way to get this components layout. It wasn't very hard sense I've been practicing everyday for the past few months on different projects. 

### Continued development

This component took me about an hour or less to complete. I'm proud to say that doing these front end projects almost everyday is helping me become more proficient. I still have lots to learn and I hope to complete all of the free front end projects as I learn more. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me see what properties I needed to use to get the layout and look needed.
